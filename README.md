Initial commit is modified code from https://github.com/CambridgeIIS/mid_air_gesture_keyboard_decoder to work with latest Python and Tensorflow versions. The current work extends the mentioned prior art to evaluate validation loss in addition to training metrics. It also includes grid hyperaparameter search for an optimized encoder transformer model with varying - number of layers, number of attention heads and model size. None of the resulting transformer models could outperform the original work. In addition, it was found that the original model also overfit the data given a reasonable gap between training and validation loss. In conclusion, it is apparent that the data quality or more likely the quantity is the limitation here.

This work is supplementary information for a coursework project in the M.Tech program on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality for working professionals at IIT Jodhpur. The project intended to improve performance of Gesture based Augmented Reality (AR) keyboard, established from the research gap of a lack of surface & device free AR keyboard.
